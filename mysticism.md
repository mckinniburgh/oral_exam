## Mysticism, Writing, and Reading in the 20th C. 

An evolving list for the orals exam at The Graduate Center, CUNY. Weaving through the history and philosophy of religion, this list examines mysticism as a historic practice and a motif in twentieth-century writings generated through reading and writing practice. This list seeks to unpack the constellation of historical and poetic meanings invoked in the description of a work or author as "mystic," with the intention of exploring the potential mysticism inherent in all reading practice.
