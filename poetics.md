## Lineage and New American Poetry

An evolving list for the orals exam at The Graduate Center, CUNY. This list explores the rise of poetry according to Olson's conception of the postmodern, navigating through designations such as the Beats, New American Poetry, the Black Mountain poets, and beyond. 

In addition to a few guiding theoretical texts, this list will focus on reading poets for both their creative works and their correspondence. By reading poems alongside letters, this list fleshes out the historical, social, and cultural dimensions of poetic praxis as an inclusive framework for a more capacious style of literary criticism.
